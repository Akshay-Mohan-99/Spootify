# Spotify Spoof

This app was created as a spoof to spotify using Client Side Auth feature of Spotify official API. This is a simple project showing two playlists fetching all the data including songs, album name, duration of the song etc. Tried to replicated the same UI looks of spotify. This is client auth only so user information is not available as the authentication is on the App level.

This uses plain CSS for styling. I have implemented REDUX in this project for state management. All the async calls are managed by Redux Thunks.

This is a Screenshot of the App.
